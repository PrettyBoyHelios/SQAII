## Contributing

All contributions to this repository must be through the creation of Pull Requests and their review. General rules for contributing are described below.

* Please follow PEP8 code formatting guidelines.  
* All Test Suites must inherit from the suites.suite.Suite class to ensure compatibility with the rest of the framework.  
* Please add all of your test cases to the execute_suite() method in every TestSuite that inherits from suites.suite.Suite  


## Framework Reporting
The testing framework generates csv files, separated by date under the log/ folder. Application reports are stored under the CSV format so that test results can be easily imported into Microsoft Excel or any other spreadsheet software.
